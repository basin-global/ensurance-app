# Fundamentals

In the face of rapid environmental, technological, and social change, Natural Capital Ensurance reduces systemic risk and ensures resilience.  

Natural capital is the stocks of living and non-living natural phenomena that generate flows of benefits essential to all life.

Ensurance safeguards 14 stocks and 19 flows of natural capital, ensuring ecosystem function: 
- Stocks include forests, wetlands, grasslands to urban and coastal ecosystems. 
- Flows include essential resources like clean air, water, food, energy, climate stability, risk resilience, and additional cultural and ecological benefits.

Ensurance applies real asset fundamentals to proactively and perpetually fund natural assets and the people who steward them. It operates at all scales, in any location, across initiatives focused on place, purpose, or people.

## BASIN SITUS: A Resilience Hyperstructure
The BASIN SITUS Protocol is designed for adaptive capacity, balancing present and future needs. It is:
- Open-source
- Composable
- Interoperable
- Modular
- Extensible
- Non-custodial
- Censorship-resistant
- Configurable

Like natural systems, the polycentric design operates through five interconnected components:
- Groups 
- Accounts/Agents
- Assets
- Currency
- Mechanisms

## Groups
Groups are organizations, communities, or networks formed to increase resilience and reduce risk.

Each Group has a unique namespace, such as .basin or .refi, with members holding accounts like elk.basin or node-name-here.refi.

Every Group operates on its own onchain contract, deployed from the SITUS factory and fully owned by the Group.

Groups are autonomous and control:
- How new accounts are issued
- Metadata and governance settings
- Key contract functions

At the core of every Group are Accounts, which represent individuals, entities, or agents participating in the ecosystem

## Accounts / Agents
Accounts are the Members of Groups, representing anything the Group defines—people, places, projects, or purpose (e.g., species, impact initiatives, etc.).

Each Account has:
- A unique onchain name within its Group
- A cross-chain Ethereum wallet, enabling transactions and interactions
- The ability to hold, send, and transact using fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible value

Agents are Accounts that integrate with ensurance.app via ElizaOS, enabling semi-autonomous actions based on predefined specifications.

## Assets
Assets are the non-fungible and semi-fungible tokens that Accounts and Agents hold and operate.

Assets can be held, sold, sent, swapped, converted, or burned.

### Certificates of Ensurance
The primary asset in BASIN SITUS is the Certificate of Ensurance, issued by Groups and Members to fund natural assets and ecosystem services.

## Currency
Currencies provide fungible value that Groups, Accounts, and Agents use to advance their mission. These currencies integrate into DeFi ecosystems, enabling mission-driven financial strategies.

### $ENSURE: Nature-Based Currency
Historically, money has been backed by society's most fundamental real assets—from shells and tulip bulbs to gold and oil. 

Now, we can ensure the foundation of all wealth, the most essential real asset: functioning ecosystems full of biodiversity.

$ENSURE serves as both money and mechanism- a currency based on nature’s real value, facilitating:

- Certificate of Ensurance creation
- Agentification (transitioning Accounts into Agents)
- Ensurance Syndicates (collaborative funding structures)

Through these mechanisms, $ENSURE is foundational to closing the global $1T biodiversity funding gap.

## Mechanisms

Mechanisms are modeled after natural cycles—specifically, the water cycle—to keep the protocol in motion.

FLOWS circulate through the system, distributing funding through multiple input and output points. FLOWS always cycle back to the HEADWATERS, which provides:
- Instance-based funding
- Time-based funding (ranging from 3 months to 512 years).

FLOWS continuously fund Groups, Members, Agents, and core operations.

Other key mechanisms include:
- Ensurance Pools
- Ensurance Syndicates
- Protocol Rewards

## Summary
Natural Capital Ensurance ensures the fundamental stocks and flows of nature are properly valued, secured, and sustained. 

Powered by BASIN and SITUS, the protocol combines real assets, regenerative finance, and automation to scale ecosystem protection and restoration, risk reduction, and resilience-building worldwide.
