# Fundamentals

In the face of rapid environmental, technological, and social change, Natural Capital Ensurance reduces systemic risk and ensures resilience.  

Natural capital is the stocks of living and non-living natural phenomena that generate flows of benefits essential to all life.

Ensurance safeguards 15 stocks and 19 flows of natural capital, ensuring ecosystem function: 
- Stocks include forests, wetlands, grasslands to urban and coastal ecosystems. 
- Flows include essential resources like clean air, water, food, energy, climate stability, risk resilience, and additional cultural and ecological benefits.

Ensurance applies real asset fundamentals to proactively and perpetually fund natural assets and the people who steward them. It operates at all scales, in any location, across initiatives focused on place, purpose, or people.

## A Resilience Hyperstructure
Ensurance is designed for adaptive capacity, balancing present and future needs. It is:
- Open-source
- Composable
- Interoperable
- Modular
- Extensible
- Non-custodial
- Censorship-resistant
- Configurable

Like natural systems, the polycentric design operates through five interconnected components:
- Groups 
- Accounts/Agents
- Assets
- Currency
- Mechanisms

## Groups
Groups are organizations, communities, or networks formed to increase resilience and reduce risk.

Each Group has a unique namespace, such as .basin or .refi, with members having accounts like elk.basin or node-name-here.refi.

Every Group operates on its own onchain contract fully owned by the Group.

Groups are autonomous and control:
- How new accounts are issued
- Metadata and governance settings
- Key contract functions

At the core of every Group are Accounts, which represent individuals, entities, or agents participating in the ecosystem.

## Accounts / Agents
Accounts are the Members of Groups, representing anything the Group defines—people, places, projects, or purpose (e.g., species, impact initiatives, etc.).

Each Account has:
- A unique onchain name within its Group
- A cross-chain Ethereum wallet, enabling transactions and interactions
- The ability to hold, send, and transact using fungible (currency) and non-fungible and semi-fungible (assets) value

Agents are Accounts that integrate with ensurance.app via ElizaOS, enabling semi-autonomous actions based on predefined specifications.

## Assets
Assets are the non-fungible and semi-fungible tokens that Accounts and Agents hold and operate.

Assets can be held, sold, sent, swapped, converted, or burned.

## Currency
Currencies provide fungible value that Groups, Accounts, and Agents use to advance their mission. These currencies integrate into DeFi ecosystems, enabling mission-driven financial strategies.

### Certificates of Ensurance
Certificates of Ensurance are currencies and assets that Groups issue to fund natural assets, ecosystem services, and Group operations. They bridge traditional finance with natural capital value.

Two types of Certificates enable flexible funding approaches:

- **General Ensurance** values what matters, flowing like a currency where market activity indirectly funds place, people, and purpose.
- **Specific Ensurance** protects what matters, anchoring as an asset to directly fund natural assets and stewardship.

### $ENSURE: Nature-Based Currency
Historically, money has been backed by society's most fundamental real assets—from shells and tulip bulbs to gold and oil. 

Now, we can ensure the foundation of all wealth, the most essential real asset: functioning ecosystems full of biodiversity.

$ENSURE serves as both money and mechanism - a utility currency that connects and powers Natural Capital Ensurance. As the common medium of exchange across thousands of natural capital currencies and assets, it enables seamless value flow between all participants and components of the system.

Through these interconnections, $ENSURE is foundational to closing the global $1T biodiversity funding gap.

## Mechanisms

Mechanisms are modeled after natural cycles—specifically, the water cycle—powering Ensurance's perpetual flywheel.

Ensurance Proceeds circulate throughout Natural Capital Ensurance, distributing funding to all participants. The proceeds system provides:
- Instance-based funding
- Time-based funding
- Continuous support for Groups, Members, and Agents

Key mechanisms include:
- Ensurance Pools
- Ensurance Syndicates
- Protocol Rewards
- Ensurance Exchange

## Summary
Natural Capital Ensurance ensures the fundamental stocks and flows of nature are properly valued, secured, and sustained. 

Ensurance transforms risk reduction costs into investment opportunities, combining real assets, blended finance, and AI to scale ecosystem protection and restoration worldwide.
