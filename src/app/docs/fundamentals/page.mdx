# Fundamentals

In the face of rapid environmental, technological, and social change, Natural Capital Ensurance reduces systemic risk and ensures resilience.  

Natural capital is the stock of renewable and non-renewable natural resources that combine to yield a flow of benefits that all life depends.

Ensurance safeguards 14 stocks and 19 flows of natural capital, ensuring the resilience of ecosystems and the services they provide. Stocks range from forests, wetlands, and grasslands to urban and coastal systems. Flows include essential resources like clean air, water, food, energy, climate stability, risk resilience, and additional cultural and ecological benefits.

Ensurance is proactive rather reactive and creates a perpetual funding system for the natural assets that provide the benefits and for the people who steward them. Ensurance operates at all scales, in any location, for initiatives focused on place, purpose, or people.

As a resilience hyperstructure, the BASIN SITUS Protocol is:
- Open-source
- Composable
- Interoperable
- Modular
- Extensible
- Non-custodial
- Censorship-resistant
- Configurable as permissioned or permissionless

Like natural systems, the polycentric system operates through five interconnected components:
- Groups 
- Accounts/Agents
- Assets
- Currency
- Mechanisms

## Groups

Groups are organizations, communities, or networks formed to increase resilience and reduce risk.

Each Group has a unique namespace, such as .basin or .refi, with members holding accounts like elk.basin or node-name-here.refi.

Every Group operates on its own onchain contract, deployed from the SITUS factory and fully owned by the Group.

Groups are autonomous and can operate however they choose. They control key contract functions including how new accounts are issued, metadata, and more.

At the core of every Group are Accounts, representing individuals, entities, or agents participating within the Group's ecosystem and BASIN SITUS as a whole.

## Accounts / Agents

Accounts are the Members of Groups. They can represent anything the Group defines—people, places, projects, or purpose (e.g., species, impact initiatives, etc.).

Each Account is operated by its Owner, which can be either an individual or a Group.

All Accounts are unique and have immutable attributes: a unique onchain name within the Group's namespace and a cross-chain Ethereum wallet, enabling onchain interactions.

Accounts can hold, send, and transact using multiple Ethereum standards: fungible, non-fungible and semi-fungible.

Accounts can become Agents by integrating with ensurance.app via ElizaOS. Agents are semi-autonomous and can act according to pre-defined specifications.

## Assets

Assets are the non-fungible and semi-fungible tokens that Accounts and Agents hold and operate.

Assets can be held, sold, sent, swapped, converted, or burned.

The primary asset in the BASIN SITUS Protocol is the Certificate of Ensurance. These certificates are issued by Groups and Members to fund their work and the stocks and flows of natural capital, and represent nature-based value.

## Currency

Currency represents fungible value that Groups, Accounts, and Agents use to support their mission. Currencies can be integrated into DeFi ecosystems, enabling mission-driven financial strategies.

$ENSURE is the nature-based currency of the BASIN SITUS Protocol.

Historically, money has been backed by what society collectively values—shells, tulip bulbs, coal, gold, oil. Today, we can now ensure that the foundation of all wealth is functioning ecosystems full of biodiversity.

$ENSURE aligns monetary value with nature's value, supporting long-term resilience and well-being facilitating:

- Certificate of Ensurance creation
- Agentification (transitioning Accounts into Agents)
- Ensurance Syndicates (collaborative funding structures)

## Mechanisms

Mechanisms are modeled after the water cycle and are what run the protocol.

FLOWS circulates through the protocol producing a diverse range of funding across multiple input and output points. FLOWS always cycle back to the HEADWATERS which has both instance based funding and time based funding ( 3 months to 512 years).  FLOWS continuously fund Groups, Members, Agents and core operations.

Other mechanisms include Ensurance Pools and Syndicates and protocol rewards.
