# Zora Coins

> **Documentation Note**: This guide reflects the implementation of Zora Coins as of February 2024. For the most current information, please refer to the [official Zora documentation](https://docs.zora.co/).

## Implementation Notes

### Contract Addresses (Base Network)
- Factory: `0x777777751622c0d3258f214F9DF38E35BF45baF3`
- Implementation: `0x6B78be0808262b1d5E9B1eeDfE448aDCE2C637a8`

### Key Events to Monitor
```solidity
// Factory events
event CoinCreated(...)  // Emitted on deploy()

// Coin contract events
event CoinBuy(...)      // Emitted on buy()
event CoinSell(...)     // Emitted on sell()
event TradeRewards(...) // Trading fee distributions
event MarketRewards(...) // LP fee distributions
event CoinPayoutRecipientUpdated(...) // Creator reward address changes
event ContractMetadataUpdated(...)    // Metadata URI updates
```

### SDK Status
Currently implementing direct contract interactions until official Zora Coins SDK is released. Key integration points:
- Factory's `deploy()` for coin creation
- Individual coin's `buy()` and `sell()` for trading
- Event monitoring for rewards and updates
- Protocol Rewards contract for fee distribution

## Contract Roles

### Payout Recipient (Creator)
- Receives initial 10M tokens (1% of supply)
- Collects 50% of trading fees
- Collects 50% of LP fees
- Can be updated by owners via `setPayoutRecipient()`

### Contract Owners
- Set during initialization as array of addresses
- Multiple owners possible through `MultiOwnable`
- Admin rights to:
  - Update payout recipient
  - Update contract metadata
  - Other admin functions

### Minter/Deployer
- Account that calls factory's `deploy()`
- Can be different from creator/owners
- Often a platform account deploying on behalf of creator

Note: The "creator" (payout recipient) and contract owners can be different addresses. A platform could deploy and own the contract while setting a creator as the payout recipient.

## Overview

Zora Coins are ERC20 tokens created through a factory system that integrates with Uniswap V3 for liquidity and includes built-in reward distribution mechanisms.

## Contract Architecture

### Factory Contract
The `ZoraFactoryImpl` contract creates new Zora Coin instances using minimal proxies (EIP-1167). Each deployment configures:
- Payout recipient (creator)
- Token URI (metadata)
- Name and symbol
- Platform referrer
- Currency (ETH/WETH or ERC20)
- Initial pool configuration

### Coin Implementation
Each Zora Coin is an ERC20 token with:
- Upgradeable contracts (OpenZeppelin)
- Multi-owner capability
- Automatic liquidity pool creation
- Built-in reward distribution
- Reentrancy protection

## Core Constants

All Zora Coins share the same immutable constants defined in the `CoinConstants` contract. These values cannot be changed after deployment.

### Supply Distribution
```solidity
// Total supply: 1 billion coins
MAX_TOTAL_SUPPLY = 1_000_000_000e18

// Initial distribution:
POOL_LAUNCH_SUPPLY = 990_000_000e18    // 99% to liquidity pool
CREATOR_LAUNCH_REWARD = 10_000_000e18   // 1% to creator
```

### Trading Parameters
```solidity
// Minimum trade size
MIN_ORDER_SIZE = 0.0000001 ether    // Prevents dust transactions

// Uniswap V3 pool fee
LP_FEE = 10000                      // 1% fee on all trades
```

### Fee Structure
All fees are specified in basis points (1 bps = 0.01%):

#### Trading Fees (1% total)
| Recipient | Basis Points | Percentage |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Creator | 5000 | 50% |
| Protocol | 2000 | 20% |
| Platform Referrer | 1500 | 15% |
| Trade Referrer | 1500 | 15% |

#### LP Fee Distribution
| Recipient | Basis Points | Percentage |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Creator | 5000 | 50% |
| Platform Referrer | 2500 | 25% |
| Protocol | 2500 | 25% |

### Pool Configuration
```solidity
// Price range for WETH pairs
LP_TICK_LOWER_WETH = -199200
LP_TICK_UPPER = 887200
```

## Key Features

### Liquidity Management
- Automatic Uniswap V3 pool creation
- Configurable initial tick range
- 1% pool fee structure
- Initial supply split between creator and pool

### Trading Mechanics
- Buy/sell functionality through Uniswap V3
- Slippage protection
- Support for both ETH and ERC20 trading pairs
- Automatic reward distribution on trades

### Reward System
Integrated with Protocol Rewards contract (`0x7777777F279eba3d3Ad8F4E708545291A6fDBA8B`):
- Creator rewards
- Platform referrer rewards
- Trade referrer rewards
- Protocol fees
- Market rewards from LP fees

## External System Integration

### Comments System
Contract Address: `0x7777777C2B3132e03a65721a41745C07170a5877`

Coins provide three key functions for the comments system:
```solidity
interface ICoinComments {
    function isOwner(address) external view returns (bool);
    function payoutRecipient() external view returns (address);
    function balanceOf(address) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

### Protocol Rewards
Contract Address: `0x7777777F279eba3d3Ad8F4E708545291A6fDBA8B`

Handles distribution of:
- Trading fees
- Market rewards
- Referral rewards
- Protocol fees

## Implementation Notes

### Deployment Parameters
```solidity
function initialize(
    address payoutRecipient_,
    address[] memory owners_,
    string memory tokenURI_,
    string memory name_,
    string memory symbol_,
    address platformReferrer_,
    address currency_,
    int24 tickLower_
) public initializer
```

### Fee Structure

Market rewards from LP fees are split between:
- Creator
- Platform referrer
- Protocol
