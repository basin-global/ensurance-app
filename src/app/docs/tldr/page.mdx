# TLDR

Society and the economy are 100% dependent on nature.

The foundation of all wealth—physical, financial, spiritual—is in steep decline and at a critical tipping point. Biodiversity needs $1T in annual investment to avoid systemic collapse.

Natural Capital Ensurance is the transdisciplinary protocol, built by BASIN and powered by SITUS, to ensure the benefits nature provides to all beings.

Any group, person, or agent can invest, rather than donate or expense, to:
- Reduce risk
- Increase resilience
- Enhance well-being

Investments yield returns across financial, ecological, social, and cultural dimensions while honoring nature's intrinsic value.
