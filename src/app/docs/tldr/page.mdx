# TLDR

Society and the economy are 100% dependent on nature.

The foundation of all wealth—physical, financial, spiritual—is in steep decline, nearing a critical tipping point. Avoiding systemic collapse requires $1T in annual investment in biodiversity.

Natural Capital Ensurance, by BASIN, transforms how we value and fund nature. This hyperstructure ensures the benefits nature provides to all beings.

Instead of donating or expensing, any group, person, or agent can invest to:
- Reduce risk
- Increase resilience
- Enhance well-being

Ensurance investments secure real assets that generate financial, ecological, social, and cultural returns, while honoring nature's intrinsic value.
