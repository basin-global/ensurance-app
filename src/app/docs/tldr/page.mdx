# TLDR

Society and the economy are 100% dependent on nature.

Yet the foundation of all wealth—physical, financial, spiritual—is in rapid decline, nearing irreversible tipping points. Avoiding systemic collapse requires $1T annual investment in biodiversity and natural capital.

**Natural Capital Ensurance**, by BASIN, transforms how we value and fund nature-ensuring the benefits it provides to all beings.

Rather than donating or expensing, anyone-person, group, or agent-can invest to:
- Reduce risk
- Increase resilience
- Enhance well-being

These Ensurance investments secure real assets that deliver financial, ecological, social, and cultural returns-while honoring nature's intrinsic value.
