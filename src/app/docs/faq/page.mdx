## Protocol Questions

### How does Ensurance fund nature & climate projects?
The protocol uses three primary funding mechanisms:

1. **Certificates of Ensurance**
   - General Ensurance (`ERC-20`): Indirect funding through market activity
   - Specific Ensurance (`ERC-1155`): Direct funding of natural assets

2. **SITUS Accounts**
   - Token-bound accounts (`ERC-6551`)
   - Represent people, places, or projects
   - Track assets, currency, and impact metrics

3. **ENSURE Currency**
   - Nature-based utility token
   - Provides liquidity between currencies and assets
   - Cross-chain via Axelar ITS

All funds flow transparently through onchain accounts with public tracking.

### What's the difference between SITUS, BASIN, and ENSURANCE?
They work together but serve different roles:

- **BASIN**: Provides frameworks and operations for natural capital valuation and protection
- **SITUS**: Onchain protocol enabling decentralized accounts, assets, and currency
- **ENSURANCE**: The combined system protecting and regenerating natural capital

## Account Questions

### How are SITUS accounts different from domains or ENS?
SITUS accounts are onchain infrastructure that:

- Function as standalone 0x wallets with unique IDs
- Have no renewal fees (one-time purchase)
- Can hold and transfer any ERC token
- Are fully controlled by the account holder
- Work on any Base L2 compatible interface
- Can integrate with ENS (optional)

### How do I manage my SITUS account?

**Creation**
- Visit any Group's CREATE page
- No limit on accounts or group memberships
- One-time purchase, no renewals

**Management**
- Transfer to other wallets
- Trade on any NFT marketplace
- Burn (permanently delete)
- Compatible with most Ethereum wallets

## Natural Capital Questions

### Is it ethical to put a price on nature?
Nature is already priced through:

- Resource extraction
- Land development
- Ecosystem services

Ensurance provides a framework to value preservation and regeneration.

### How does Ensurance relate to traditional insurance?
Ensurance complements traditional insurance by:

- Lowering premiums for insureds
- Reducing underwriting risk
- De-risking land investments
- Protecting ecosystem services

### Can Ensurance work with other credits/certificates?
Yes! Ensurance encourages:

- "Stacking" with other credits
- "Bundling" for project feasibility
- Proper reconciliation between systems
- Enhanced market opportunities

## Group Questions

### How do I create a SITUS namespace for my organization?
Any group focused on place-based resilience can apply:

1. Contact us to start the process
2. Demonstrate community alignment
3. Commit to transparent governance

*Note: All groups must support natural capital protection*
