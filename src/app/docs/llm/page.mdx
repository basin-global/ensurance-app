## Integration Notes

These files are generated using [Repomix](https://repomix.com/), a tool that packages entire codebases into AI-friendly formats. The codebase file is updated regularly to reflect the current state of the ensurance protocol.

AI agents can use these files to:
- Understand the complete ensurance ecosystem
- Provide informed recommendations to operators
- Analyze market data and portfolio performance
- Help operators navigate natural capital investments
- Support decision-making with full technical context
