# ENSURANCE
## Critical Infrastructure

Society and the economy are 100% dependent on Nature. All well-being is inextricably linked to the collective health of our planet's deeply interconnected ecological systems.

Nature, biodiversity, and people are the critical infrastructure of our world. Natural Capital Ensurance, **ensures** the protection and regeneration of this critical infrastructure. 

## Overview

Built by BASIN, Natural Capital Ensurance transforms how we value and fund nature. This resilience hyperstructure ensures the benefits nature provides to all beings.

Groups and Agents form Ensurance Syndicates and utilize Pools that fund 14 critical ecosystems & 19 vital ecosystem services crucial to all life. Certificates of Ensurance properly value natural assets, while the nature-based currency $ENSURE drives investment into the $1T biodiversity gap.

⚡ reduced risk · increased resilience · greater wellbeing ⚡

### Insurance v. Ensurance
Traditional insurance is reactive—it compensates for loss after damage occurs.

Ensurance is proactive. It protects ecosystems from day one, with a clear path to permanent protection, restoration, and ongoing stewardship funding.

### Implementation
There are two types of Ensurance:
- General Ensurance: Support broad initiatives through indirect funding mechanisms, allowing price discovery and valuation for the people, places, and purposes they represent (e.g., water conservation across a region)
- Specific Ensurance: Create direct funding pathways to defined real assets, enabling targeted support for concrete projects (e.g., specific water conservation projects at identified properties)

### Core Purpose
Natural Capital Ensurance places valuable natural assets in permanent trust (ENTRUST), securing their benefits for all life.

Ensurance makes this possible.

## Roles & Participants

### Groups
Groups are organizations, communities, or networks formed to increase resilience and reduce risk and who are members of ENSURANCE DUNA via contracts and accounts.

Groups create Certificates of Ensurance to ensure what is important to them.

### Agents
Ensurance Agents are Accounts that are Members of Groups, representing anything the Group defines—people, places, projects, or purpose (e.g., species, impact initiatives, etc.). An Ensurance Agent can be a human operated Account or an agent (LLM) operated Account.

### Ensured
Unique to Ensurance, the Ensured is nature itself, which by definition includes humans, society and the economy. 

Ensured is further delineated  as:
- Policyholder - These are Certificate Holders. General policyholders receive protocol rewards. Specific policyholders (tied to specific real asset) receive protocol rewards and can make ecological data claims about the specific natural asset.
- Natural Asset: A specific real asset containing defined ecosystem extent, characteristics and condition that has a Policy that has been written for it.
- Additional Ensured- those who benefit as a result of Ensurance whether or not they contribute to Ensurance Polices.  e.g. species, society, economy

### Underwriter
The underwriter is responsible for evaluating and deciding the risk of ensuring specific natural assets, determining policy terms, establishing premiums, working with Ensurers, Ensurance Agents and the ENTRUST. The primary underwriter is BASIN LLC which utilizes the RealValue of Natural Capital Framework to value natural assets.

### Ensurer
The Ensurer funds the Ensurance policy, bearing the risk in exchange for Ensurance premiums paid by the Policyholders and/or the Protocol. Ensurer's are Members that are either market rate investors, philanthropic funders, or blended finance vehicles that fund the real asset cost upfront and during the policy period.

### ENTRUST
Once the Ensurance Premium has been paid in full and the Ensurance Policy has ended, the natural asset (land/ecosystem) goes into permanent trust. Trust and holding company structures vary based on asset and jurisdiction but all include land use restrictions at the title level and are managed on behalf of Nature by the Protocol.

## Mechanics & Implementation

### Certificates
Certificates of Ensurance are the core currencies and assets of Natural Capital Ensurance. Certificates represent the unique and diverse values we seek to ensure.

General Certificates can be issued by any Group to ensure what is important to them. As a currency, general certificates allow natural price discovery, proper valuation, and market fluctuations to fund natural capital.

Specific Certificates are issued based on the dollar value specific natural assets.

Specific Certificates revieve protocol rewards and holders can make prorata ecological data claims. General certificates provide access to liquidity.

All Certificates can be swapped for $ENSURE as well as for each other.

### Pools
Ensurance Pools are dedicated investment vehicles designed to manage the stocks and flows of natural capital through a structured portfolio of 33 pools—14 ecosystems and 19 ecosystem services that sustain life.

These pools blend traditional and decentralized investment management techniques to maximize assets under management (AUM) while ensuring capital is deployed effectively for the purpose of each pool—whether for conservation, restoration, resilience, or yield-driven impact.

Each Ensurance Pool functions as a specialized capital allocation mechanism, ensuring that investment flows are directed toward maintaining and enhancing the ecological and financial stability of natural capital. Pools act as an additional capital and yield source for Syndicates and Groups.

### Syndicates
Ensurance Syndicates are yield bearing vaults for very specific purposes denominated in one underlying currency.  

Syndicate examples:
- aquifer recharge in west Texas (USDC)
- hemp farms in turkey (DAI)
- Coconut Farms in the Caribbean (ENSURE)
- Beaver Habitat (ENSURE)
- Urban Heat Islands (GLO Dollar)
- solar projects in global south (EARTH)

Groups and Members can form Syndicates. Anyone can permissionlessly invest and withdrawal at any time.

### Policies
The Policy is the specifications of the natural asset, the cost, and length as determined by the Underwriter.

Policies have Ensurers, Policyholders and Premiums. Ensurers and Policyholders are covered above. 

The premium is the annual cost of the Ensurance Policy. The premium is calculated based off of the relationship between the annual RealValue, capital providers (Ensurers), and the underlying real asset cost/value. This relationship calculates cost options to put the ecosystem in permanent trust either today, 2030, 2040, or 2050. Alternatively, Ensurance Premiums can be calculated for any custom # of years including a minimum premium amount which is the lowest cost but only protects the ecosystem year by year, albeit not permanently until a formal policy is issued.

Fun fact: The term "premium" has its origins in the Latin word "praemium," which means "reward" or "prize." While premium has different meanings today, the historical definition is highly applicable to Ensurance: premiums were seen as payments for securing a service or benefit, often with a positive connotation of receiving something valuable in return. What greater value is there than nature itself?

### Binder
The Ensurance Binder is a record of all the real assets considered for or part of Ensurance.

Ensurance Slips.
Slips are the precursor to policies with each slip containing all the preliminary data needed for a natural asset to be considered for a formal policy.

### Proceeds
Ensurance Proceeds, modeled after natural water cycles, create a perpetual flywheel of funding throughout the system. Like water flowing from headwaters through streams and estuaries, proceeds move through:

- Instance-based distributions: Immediate funding for critical needs
- Time-based allocations: Sustained support from 3 months to 512 years
- Continuous flows: Ongoing funding for Groups, Members, and ecosystem stewardship

This natural cycle ensures resources flow where needed while maintaining the system's long-term health and resilience.
