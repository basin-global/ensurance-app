# Ensurance App - Domain Setup History

## Historical Setup (Deprecated)
This app was originally built to serve two domains from a single codebase:
- ensurance.app (primary)
- onchain-agents.ai (secondary)

The multi-domain setup used:
- Shared `/app` directory for common components
- `/app/onchain-agents` as entry point for onchain-agents.ai
- Middleware for domain-specific routing
- Conditional rendering with `isSite` helper

## Current Setup
The app now serves only ensurance.app, with onchain-agents.ai redirecting to it via DNS:

### URLs
- Production: `https://ensurance.app`
- Development: `localhost:3000`

### Legacy Code Notice
Some multi-domain code may still exist in the codebase:
- `isSite` checks in components
- Site context providers
- Domain-specific routing logic

These remnants are gradually being cleaned up but don't affect functionality as all traffic now routes to ensurance.app.
